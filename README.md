# Weather Application

This is my first time using React.js and OpenWeather API to create a weather application that takes in the input of the city or the country and spits out some interesting information on the weather.

## What I've Learnt

1. Using React.js to build applications.
2. The usage of useState, a React Hook that adds state to a functional component. In this project I declared a variables and a function. The function updates the varibale anytime the setter is called, in this case, its the handleSubmit function.
3. Learnt how to call an API using an API Key and a HTTPS link. In this project I used OpenWeather API.
4. Used Bootstrap to design the layout of the card, making use of styles, padding, margins, and flexbox.
